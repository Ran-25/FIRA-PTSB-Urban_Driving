# FIRA-PTSB Urban Driving

## Overview  
This repository contains the implementation of the **FIRA-PTSB Urban Driving** project, focused on autonomous driving in urban environments. It includes algorithms, models, and simulation setups designed to handle real-world driving scenarios.  

## Features  
- **Autonomous Navigation** – Implemented path planning and obstacle avoidance.  
- **Perception System** – Uses sensor data to detect objects and lane markings.  
- **Simulation & Testing** – Includes testing in a controlled urban environment.  

## Installation  
### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed before running the project:  
- Python 3.x  
- ROS Noetic (if applicable)  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (if using deep learning models)  

### Setup  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh  
   git clone https://github.com/Ran-25/FIRA-PTSB-Urban_Driving.git  
   cd FIRA-PTSB-Urban_Driving  
   ```
